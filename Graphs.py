Consider an undirected graph where each edge weighs 6 units. Each of the nodes is
 labeled consecutively from 1 to n.

You will be given a number of queries. For each query, you will be given a list of 
edges describing an undirected graph. After you create a representation of the graph, 

you must determine and report the shortest distance to each of the other nodes from a given 
starting position using the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS). Return an array of distances 
from the start node in node number order. If a node is unreachable, return -1
for that node. 
Sample Input

2   - no of queries

4 2 - 4= nodes 2 - edges
1 2 - u,v - describe an edge
1 3 - u,v - describe an edge
1   - starting node

3 1 - noofNodes, noOfedges
2 3 - u,v
2   - starting node

Sample Output

6 6 -1

Prims algo - leet code 1584
You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points 
on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] 
and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, 
where |val| denotes the absolute value of val. Return the minimum cost to make all
points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple
path between any two points.

Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
Output: 20
Explanation: 

We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.

Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
Output: 18

Constraints:

    1 <= points.length <= 1000
    -106 <= xi, yi <= 106
    All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.

Network Delay Time - Dijkstra's algorithm - Leetcode 743
You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times,
 a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is 
 the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a 
 signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for
 all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes
to receive the signal, return -1.

Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2

    edges = dict()
    for u,v,w in times:
        if u in edges:
            edges[u].append([v,w])
        else:
            edges[u] = [[v,w]]

What is the difference between Prim and Dijkstra?

Comparing Prims and Dijkstra Algorithms

we have the MSpanning tree T of the graph . 
Note that an MST always contains all vertices of the original graph.

Shortest path -
a shortest-path tree may not contain all vertices of the original graph.

In the computation aspect, Prims and Dijkstras algorithms have three main differences:

    Dijkstras algorithm finds the shortest path, but Prims algorithm finds the MST
    Dijkstras algorithm can work on both directed and undirected graphs, 
    but Prims algorithm only works on undirected graphs
    Prims algorithm can handle negative edge weights, but Dijkstras algorithm 
    may fail to accurately compute distances if at least one negative edge weight exists

In practice, Dijkstras algorithm is used when we want to save time and fuel 
traveling from one point to another. Prims algorithm, on the other hand, is used 
when we want to minimize material costs in constructing roads that connect
multiple points to each other.
